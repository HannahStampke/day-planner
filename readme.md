The assignment-

Create a daily planner that has these elements:
    the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar ✔️
    timeblocks for standard business hours ✔️
    Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
    I can enter an event ✔️
    The text for that event is saved in local storage
    The saved events persist

I ended up looking through several walkthroughs and following Chenallee's script to figure out why my storage wasn't working.
I do not know why it isn't working and I get several issues displayed in the console.
This was challenging and I would like to revisit this as soon as time allows to find the faults and solve these problems.
